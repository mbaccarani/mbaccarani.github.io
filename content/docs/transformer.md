**Transformer-3** streamlines the generation, storage, interpretation, processing and application of any kind of molecular population genetic data.

Because of its ease of use and versatility, **Transformer-3** speeds up data transformations and analyses that are otherwise burdensome, complex and prone to error, thereby allowing the researcher to concentrate in what really matters: the critical discussion of quantitative results and hypotheses.

Helping the researcher save time, **Transformer-3** permits the effective implementation of urgency in the growing number of practical applications of molecular population genetic information.

**Transformer-3** is suitable to speed up the statistical analysis of both co-dominant (allozyme or microsatellite) and dominant (AFLP, RAPD, RFLP) data matrices containing up to 66,000 diploid individuals distributed in a maximum of 50 populations.

Use the program only in a PC. Since **Transformer-3** runs macros, check that your macro security is set at least to medium, and also make sure that you do not have Excel add-ins in your computer, as these might interfere with some commands in **Transformer-3**.

**Transformer-3** can be downloaded without charge, and may be distributed freely if and when (i) it does not undergo any modification, (ii) the manual and the three example files are attached without changes, and (iii) it is adequately cited in all papers and communications as follows:

#### Important Note:

In some languages the combination of keys to draw an allele, to draw a phantom band or to draw a heterodimer, coincide with some of the excel menu options. To overcome this problem, the following links allow you to download a modified version of Transformer where:

- To draw an allele band press    [ALT] + [1] .
- To draw a phantom band press    [ALT] + [2] .
- To insert an heterodimer press  [ALT] + [3] .
